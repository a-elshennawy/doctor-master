thing i fixed

1- in case testing only local you can make your vit.config.js base option as you want but hosting platform will alway look for a "./" so u have to have it as i made it (go check vit.config)

2 - react-bootstrape & bootstrap (as long as you are going to use both)

3 - in you footer you had from instead of form which localhost will somehow fix it with your bootstraao classes but browser will have an issue with it (go check your footer component)
